### Problem description
I came across this coding problem on Internet and was asked by Salesforce during remote programming 
interview round 

Write an application in Java to simulate file system:  
For e.g. implement commands (which can be read from command line `System.in`):  
`ls -l` to list contents of director sorted by name.   
`cd ..` to go to parent directory.   
`pwd` to return (print) the complete path to current directory etc.   
`mkdir` to create directory under the crrent directory
`mkfile` (not a conventional command) to create a file under the current directory

Your system will have Directory and Files. A directory can contain files and other directories.
